# 🚀 Online Scheduling System for Services

This is a project for the Database Design course at the Federal University of Pelotas (UFPel), focusing on building a complete full-stack online scheduling system for independent professionals.

## 🎯 Project Objective

The goal is to create a platform where professionals (such as barbers, doctors, therapists, etc.) can manage their calendars, and clients can book appointments automatically.

## 🏛️ Current Phase: Architecture and Data Modeling

The project is currently in the database design phase. The following artifacts have been completed and approved:

* **ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram):** The conceptual design of the database.
* **Logical Model:** The mapping of the ERD to the relational model (tables).

You can view the diagram and logical model in the `Grupo12_DER_Modelo_Lógico.pdf` file.

## 🔮 Next Steps (Roadmap)

This repository will be updated with the next phases of the project, which include:

* [ ] **(SQL):** Scripts for table creation, data insertion, and queries in PostgreSQL.
* [ ] **(Backend):** Development of a RESTful API using Node.js, Express, and TypeScript.
* [ ] **(Frontend):** Creation of the user interface (Professional's Dashboard and Client's Booking Page) with React.js.
